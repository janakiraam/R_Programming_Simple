Vectors (one-dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in a vector all have the same data type.
A list in R is similar to your to-do list at work or school: the different items on that list most likely differ in length, characteristic, type of activity that has to do be done, ...
A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.
You could say that a list is some kind super data type: you can store practically any piece of information in it!
To construct a list you use the function list(): my_list <- list(comp1, comp2 ...)
The arguments to the list function are the list components. Remember, these components can be matrices, vectors, other lists, ...
To summarize, the main difference between list and vector is that list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way... while the elements in a vector all have the same data type.
